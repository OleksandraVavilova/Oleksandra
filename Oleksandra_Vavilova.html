        <h2>Wandering the Streets of NYC: Daytime Wonders and Evening Delights</h2>
        <p>Excited to explore New York City, I've picked two favorite walking routes that mean a lot to me. These routes, one for daytime and the other for evening, offer different views of the city I always enjoy.

Daytime Route: Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, Krispy Kreme, and Empire State Building

My favorite daytime route would usually start at Rockefeller Center, I'm drawn to its historic charm and bustling atmosphere. Surrounded by iconic statues, I'm reminded of its rich history and cultural importance. Plus, it's a great place for taking photos with its grand architecture as a backdrop.

Moving forward, on our way is Bryant Park. For me, Bryant Park is more than just a park—it's a place filled with memories. Whether I'm relaxing on its grassy lawns or skating on its ice rink in winter, the park's stunning views of the city always inspire me.

As I continue along my route, I make a much-anticipated stop at Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme is a beloved doughnut destination known for its freshly baked treats and iconic glazed doughnuts. It holds a special place in my heart as a nostalgic indulgence that never fails to brighten my day with its sweetness and warmth.

The next stop in my daytime route - the Empire State Building. It is a famous skyscraper in New York City, known for its iconic Art Deco design and stunning views of the city skyline. People visit it to experience its observation decks, which offer panoramic views of New York City's landmarks and skyline, providing an unforgettable and breathtaking perspective of the city. It's a must-see attraction and I always love to stop by and enjoy the view.

Evening Route: City Hall Park, Brooklyn Bridge Promenade, Louisiana’s Pizza, and Brooklyn Bridge Park

My favorite evening walking route is starting in City Hall Park. City Hall Park, nestled in Lower Manhattan, is a peaceful escape renowned for its greenery and historical landmarks. It's a serene spot to relax and soak in the city's history.

The Brooklyn Bridge is a famous landmark connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, admired for its beauty and panoramic views of the city skyline. I enjoy walking or biking across it for leisure and to capture stunning photographs.

Louisiana’s Pizza is a cherished spot that I first discovered with my college class, and it holds a special place in my heart. It's a comfortable and joyful place, serving up delicious slices, and one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It's a must-visit destination for anyone who likes pizza.

Wrapping up my adventure, I head to Brooklyn Bridge Park, a waterfront destination where I can unwind and reflect beneath the twinkling stars. This park holds a special place in my heart because of its serene atmosphere, stunning waterfront views, and diverse offerings.

With each step of my journey, I'm reminded of the resilience, ambition, and beauty that define New York City. 


As a Psychology major student, I've learned that GIS offers valuable insights into spatial data. I see its future in psychology focused on mapping mental health resources, identifying areas of need, and studying the influence of the environment on mental well-being.</p>
